# from Python, and run a simple SQL query

# get an input filed from the form called 'fav_restaurant'
# and assign it's value to a local variable called fav_restaurant_name

# create a database cursor object, which allows us to perform SQL on the database.

#run a query depending on which button in the html form was selected.
